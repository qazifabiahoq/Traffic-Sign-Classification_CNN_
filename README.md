# Traffic Sign Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Project Overview

This project develops a deep learning model to classify traffic signs from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It aims to create an accurate, efficient image classifier capable of recognizing 43 different traffic sign categories based on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

Accurate traffic sign recognition is crucial for autonomous driving systems, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), smart city initiatives, and overall road safety. This solution addresses the challenges of real-time traffic sign detection to enhance vehicle safety and compliance with traffic regulations.

## Dataset and Data Preparation

* **Dataset Used:** German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), containing over 39,000 images spanning 43 classes of traffic signs.
* **Data Access:** The dataset was downloaded programmatically using the Kaggle API integrated within Google Colab, enabling reproducibility and automation.
* **Image Characteristics:** Images vary in size, lighting conditions, angles, and backgrounds, replicating real-world scenarios.
* **Preprocessing Steps:**

  * Images resized uniformly to 50x50 pixels for compatibility with CNN input requirements.
  * Pixel values normalized from \[0, 255] to \[0, 1] to accelerate model training convergence.
  * Labels encoded into numeric format for multi-class classification.
  * Conversion of images and labels to NumPy arrays for efficient processing.

## Model Architecture and Training

* **CNN Design:** The model includes multiple convolutional layers with pooling, followed by fully connected layers to extract spatial features effectively.
* **Training Parameters:**

  * Number of epochs: 10
  * Batch size: 246 steps per epoch
  * Loss function: Categorical cross-entropy
  * Performance metrics: Accuracy and loss monitored per epoch
* **Training Results:**

  * Training accuracy improved from approximately 31% at the start to around 89% by the final epoch.
  * Validation accuracy increased from roughly 65% to an impressive 98%.
  * Validation loss decreased steadily, indicating effective learning and minimal overfitting.

These results demonstrate the model’s strong generalization ability to unseen data, a critical factor for real-world deployment.

## Model Evaluation and Predictions

To validate the model’s performance, sample test images were evaluated with their predicted and actual labels:

* **Example 1:**

  * Traffic Sign: Speed limit (30 km/h)
  * Prediction: Correctly identified as "Speed limit (30 km/h)"
* **Example 2:**

  * Traffic Sign: Keep right
  * Prediction: Correctly classified as "Keep right"

The accurate prediction of these signs highlights the model’s reliability in recognizing diverse and critical traffic signs.
